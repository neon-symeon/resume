  description:
    I am a Certified Associate Python Programmer, adept Data Analyst, and aspiring Data Scientist. My professional
    journey began in marketing, where my focus shifted towards precise and mathematical knowledge about how things work.
    Notably, for UNICEF in 2020, I developed a custom tool in VBA to measure Direct Response from TV campaigns (DRTV
    campaign attribution), resulting in a doubling of the effectiveness of TV campaigns. During my time at KEINO
    advertising agency in 2021, I created an Order Management System using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
    
    In the realm of financial market analysis (2013-2017), I developed tools in MQL (similar to SQL) to gain insights
    into the rate of price change over specific periods. These tools proved invaluable for traders and analysts in
    identifying potential buying or selling opportunities.
    
    My passion lies in working with data, uncovering insights hidden in-between rows. I firmly believe that
    everything in the Universe follows the path of least resistance, determined by an underlying and often unseen
    structure. My goal is to become an expert in discovering this structure and, hopefully, shape it to our advantage.

      the highest conversion potential.

      I decided to venture into the investment market. During this period, I began publishing my stock market
      commentaries on one of the most popular investment websites stooq.pl (2011-2016). In the 2015 interview with
      money.pl, I presented correlations between planetary cycles and stock market tops and bottoms. This episode
      involved exploring statistical relationships between these two data sets, a topic shrouded in mystery in Poland
      but with an established presence in the Anglo-Saxon world. Furthermore, I engaged in the creation and programming
      of proprietary analytical tools in MQL (similar to C++), including oscillators and trading robots. Additionally,
      I developed analysis tools in Visual Basic for Excel.

      utilization of behavioral target groups, a fusion of TGI and Telemetric surveys.

      I established the marketing department in a dynamically growing, young company specializing in modern PVC windows
      production. We initiated the first consumer research, launched initial advertising campaigns, and implemented
      an in-house quality control program, accompanied by a simple tool I developed in Excel using VBA to gather data
      on the quality of window installation services. This program also included a reward system for the best
      installation teams, prioritizing them in subsequent contracts. During my tenure, TRAS went public on the Warsaw
      Stock Exchange (GPW) and obtained ISO quality certification. My work in Krakow resonated with colleagues in
      Warsaw, propelling me into the broader realm of marketing and advertising.
